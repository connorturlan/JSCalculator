<!-- ### JavaScript Calculator -->

<!-- This is a simple calculator.

The simple calculator uses functional programing and simple HTML forms to provide a basic interface.

The advanced calculator uses an object oriented model with a calculator object. It also provides slightly more functionality with x^2 and memory storage and management. -->

   const scope3Var = "123";
   }
2. It should have operator keys (+, -, /, \*, =)
3. It should have a display rendering the current calculation in a box at the top
4. It should also have a “.” key
5. Should render the current calculation in a box at the top (calculator display)
6. It should handle decimals
7. It doesn’t need to support orders of operation
8. It should not use eval() or Function() constructor

## Setup

It is recomended to use the [Live Server]() extention within VS Code.

However, this application can also run as is, openning the index.html file in your web browser.
